//The async operation in javascript is performed using callbacks
//Callback are very important part of JS 

//Issues with callbacks are that 
//a.Callback hell- when there are callback inside callback and goes and code becomes unmaintable//
//b.Inversion of control-When we loose control of the function by passing it to another function and we dont know will that ever execute or not//
